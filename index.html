    <h3><b>Gameplay</b></h3>
    <p>Rocket League is a video game that involves the combination of car racing and soccer, created and developed by Psyonix Studios. In the game, two teams of players are pitted against each other in a futuristic arena to duke it out in five-minute matches. Rocket League is the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars (known as SARPBC), which was created by the same developer.</p>
    <p>Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor, Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. Players control a rocket-powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals, in a way that resembles indoor soccer, with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid-air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field, enabling them to quickly cross the field, use the added momentum to hit the ball, or ram into another player's car to destroy it; in the latter case, the destroyed car respawns moments later on their team's side of the field. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight, allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can alter their car's orientation while midair, which combined with midair boosting allows for controlled flight. Players can also perform quick dodges, causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction, which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team.</p>
